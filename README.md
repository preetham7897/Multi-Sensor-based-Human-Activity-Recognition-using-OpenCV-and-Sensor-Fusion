1. Data: It can be found at https://personal.utdallas.edu/~kehtar/UTD-MHAD.html

2. Model Files for COCO and MPII: It can be found at https://www.learnopencv.com/deep-learning-based-human-pose-estimation-using-opencv-cpp-python/

3. Code Execution:
  - Skeleton Points - COCO.py or Skeleton Points - MPII.py should be executed first
  - Depth Convert.py or Inertial Convert.py should be executed (in any order, but both)
  - Data Normalization is next code to be executed
  - Prediction.py should be executed next.
  
4. File Path:cChange ‘loc’ to the main directory path for execution
